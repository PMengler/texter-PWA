# Texter-PWA

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to create a text editor that meets PWA guidelines. The goal was to create a front-end app that can be used and installed from an offline state by utilizing caching. Through the creation of this app, I learned a lot about PWA's and how to successfully debug an app of this nature.
